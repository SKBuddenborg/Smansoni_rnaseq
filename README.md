# Smansoni_rnaseq


The respository contains information and code relating to the Schistosoma mansoni bulk RNAseq project from Matt Berriman's Parasite Genomics group (Wellcome Sanger Institute and the University of Glasgow), and supporting information to the manuscript entitled "The stage- and sex-specific transcriptome of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni".

Custom code used for the analysis and generation of figures is available [here](https://github.com/SKBuddenborg/Smansoni_rnaseq/tree/main/01_Code)

**Abstract**  
The flatworm Schistosoma mansoni is an important but neglected pathogen that causes the disease intestinal schistosomiasis in millions of people worldwide. The parasite has a complex life cycle where it undergoes sexual reproduction in a definitive mammalian host and asexual clonal replication in an intermediate snail host. Understanding the molecular mechanisms used by the parasite to transition between hosts, and develop into sexually dimorphic reproductively competent adults, may reveal new strategies for parasite control. Here we present the first complete transcriptomic analysis of the S. mansoni life cycle. Focusing on eight key life stages spanning free-living water-borne and parasitic stages from both intermediate and definitive hosts, we have generated deep Illumina RNA-seq data for five replicates per sample group for a total of 75 data sets. These data, made further accessible via a user-friendly tool to visualise and explore gene expression (https://single-worms.schisto.xyz/), provide a valuable resource to understand the biology and sex-specific development of Schistosomes and will aid the interpretation of complementary genomic and functional genetics studies.


Any reuse of data or code is encouraged with due acknowledgement, either via citation of the published manuscript (when available) and/or GitHub repository. Comments, suggestions, and discussion are welcome.

Note: while much effort is made to make all data and code available, some of the code is very specific to the Sanger HPC environment and will need to be modified to work elsewhere. If you are interested in using any of it for your own work, but are stuck, please do get in touch.
